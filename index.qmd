# Introduction 

This website collects the materials for a two day workshop taking place during the [rstudio::conf 2022](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) in July 2024 at the University of ??? , The Netherlands.

# Workshop Overview

The workshop will focus on using R to ....

xxxx

Topics covered include simple variance components models, mixed models, using random coefficients and cross-level interactions, and more.
 
After completing the course, you will:

+ ~~Know the technical and substantive difference between fixed and random effects.~~
Understand random intercepts and random coefficients and know when to use each one.~~
+ ~~Know how to combine the strengths of random-effects and fixed effects approaches into a single model.~~
+ ~~Know how to estimate these models and interpret the results.~~

Though the vast majority of what you will learn in this course can be applied in any software package, the seminar will mostly use R for empirical examples and exercises.
