Understand random intercepts and random coefficients and know when to use each one.~~\nKnow how to combine the strengths of random-effects and fixed effects approaches into a single model.\nKnow how to estimate these models and interpret the results.\n\nThough the vast majority of what you will learn in this course can be applied in any software package, the seminar will mostly use R for empirical examples and exercises.\n\n\nPractical information\nPlease, do bring your laptop as no computer will be available.\n\n\nSchedule\nDay Session Start End June 2nd 2016 Beginner 08:30 12:30 June 2nd 2016 Intermediate 13:30 18:00 June 3rd 2016 Advanced 08:00 12:15\nHot & cold drinks will be served during the morning breaks."
