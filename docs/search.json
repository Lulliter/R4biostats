This course aims to introduce to the field and gives a solid understanding of data and data types, statistical inference and survey design applied to life sciences.\nSpecific topics covered include: tools for describing central tendency and variability in data; methods for performing inference on population means and proportions via sample data; statistical hypothesis testing and its application to group comparisons; issues of power and sample size in study designs; elements of machine learning algorithms for understanding data.\nWhile there are some formulae and computational elements to the course, the emphasis is on applications of acquired concepts to “real life” of research scientists.\nThough the vast majority of what you will learn in this course can be applied in any software package, the seminar will mostly use R for empirical examples and exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use R?\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\nTentative Schedule\n\nDay\nTime\nActivity\nLocation\n\n\n\n24 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 1 ~ Working with data (in R)\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 1\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n25 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 2 ~ Inference\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 2\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n26 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 3 ~ Modeling correlation and regression\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 3\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n27 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 4 ~ Intro to machine learning\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 4\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot & cold drinks will be served during the morning breaks.\nPractical information\nPlease, do bring your laptop as no computer will be available.\nAcknowledgements\nThe materials presented in this workshops have been prepared drawing from various sources:\n\nccc\nmmm\nxxxx"
