    "text": "? https://r-training.pages.uni.lu/biostat1/install_tutorial.html\nLet’s take for example the R package corrplot, a package for graphically exploring correlations. To install it for the first time, open an R session and execute:\n\n# Installing (ONLY the 1st time)\nutils::install.packages('corrplot')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you are actually using a function (install.packages) of a pre-installed package (utils) using the syntax packagename::function_name\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed a package, at every subsequent R session, you will only need to load it, like so:\n\n# Loading a package (at every session) \nbase::library (\"corrplot\")\n\n# ... or\nlibrary (corrplot)\n\nTo inquire about a package and/or its functions, you can again write in your console ?package_name or ?function_name and RStudio will open up a help page in the dedicated pane of Rstudio:\n\n# Opening Help page on package/function\n?corrplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also install and update packages using the “Packages” tab on the lower right pane of RStudio\n\nScreenshot Install/Update pckgs from RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging files and projects\nIn any analytical endeavor it is very likely that you will handle a collection of files (likely organized in folders, such as input_data, output_data, R_scripts, paper, etc.). R provides a fantastic tool for organizing all the files pertaining to a project called “R project”\n\nCreating an R Project\nCreating an R Project will keep all the files associated with a project (including invisible ones!) organized together – input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures. Besides being common practice, this has the advantage of implicitly setting the “working directory”, which is incredibly important when you need to load or output files, specifying their file path.\n\nDefining (reproducible) file paths: here\nIt is never good practice to “hard code” the file’s absolute path: most likely this will break your code as soon as you (or someone else) need to run it on a different computer, let alone within a different OS.\nSo if you source a file like this:\n\n# [NOT REPRODUCIBLE] hard coding your file path  --------------------------\nlibrary(readr)\n# File path on Mac:\ndataset &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/testuser/R4biostats/input_data/dataset.csv\")\n# Same file path on Windows:\ndataset &lt;- read_csv(\"C:\\Users\\testuser\\R4biostats\\input_data\\dataset.csv\")\n\n…it won’t work on someone else’s computer since they don’t have that same file structure!\nThis is where the fantastic here package comes in, as it will define file paths in a “reproducible manner” (anchored on the R Project).\n\nIt let’s you use relative paths, i.e. specify the file path relative to the project folder.\n\nNo more “/” v. “\\” issue (where Windows and Linus/Mac OSs differ)\n\n\n# [REPRODUCIBLE!!] Expressing your file path in a system agnostic way! --------\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Check where is my Working Directory?\nhere::here()\n    # [1] \"/Users/testuser/R4biostats\"\n\n# Then define file path as (\"subfolder_name\", \"file_name\")\n# No \"\\\" or \"/\" needed!\ndataset &lt;- read_csv(here(\"input_data\", \"dataset.csv\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nThe here package uses the top-level directory of a project (where you have placed your proj_name.Rproj) as the reference to easily, and portably, build paths to files.\n\n\n\n#?

R packages that will be required for the workshop\nTo install an R package, open an R session execute:\n\n# Installing (only the 1st time)\npkg_list &lt;- c(\"tidyverse\", \"quarto\", \"rmarkdown\", \"palmerpenguins\")\ninstall.packages(pkg_list)\n\n# Loading a package (at every session) \nlibrary (\"tidyverse\")"

This course aims to introduce to the field and gives a solid understanding of data and data types, statistical inference and survey design applied to life sciences.\nSpecific topics covered include: tools for describing central tendency and variability in data; methods for performing inference on population means and proportions via sample data; statistical hypothesis testing and its application to group comparisons; issues of power and sample size in study designs; elements of machine learning algorithms for understanding data.\nWhile there are some formulae and computational elements to the course, the emphasis is on applications of acquired concepts to “real life” of research scientists.\nThough the vast majority of what you will learn in this course can be applied in any software package, the seminar will mostly use R for empirical examples and exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use R?\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\nTentative Schedule\n\nDay\nTime\nActivity\nLocation\n\n\n\n24 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 1 ~ Working with data (in R)\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 1\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n25 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 2 ~ Inference\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 2\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n26 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 3 ~ Modeling correlation and regression\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 3\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n27 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 4 ~ Intro to machine learning\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 4\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot & cold drinks will be served during the morning breaks.\nPractical information\nPlease, do bring your laptop as no computer will be available.\nAcknowledgements\nThe materials presented in this workshops have been prepared drawing from various sources:\n\nccc\nmmm\nxxxx"
