It depends on the situation, but you may want to consider:\n\nhow recent/popular/well maintained is a {package} (this affects its stability)\nthe more a function abstracts away complexity, the easier it is to use interactively, but the harder it gets to handle inside your own custom functions\ndifferent function outputs may be more/less suitable for your analysis/publication requirements (check out your peers’ choices!)\n(Always read the documentation to assess all of the above)\n\n\nWith easy equations, breaking them down “by hand” (at least once!) can really help you understand them\nIt may seem a lot of work to write R code the first time 🥵 (e.g. for a publication-ready plot), but the good news is once you wrote a script, you will be able to easily re-use it in many more instances 🙌🏻 😃\nSample size n has a very powerful impact on classical hypothesis testing results!

This course aims to introduce to the field and gives a solid understanding of data and data types, statistical inference and survey design applied to life sciences.\nSpecific topics covered include: tools for describing central tendency and variability in data; methods for performing inference on population means and proportions via sample data; statistical hypothesis testing and its application to group comparisons; issues of power and sample size in study designs; elements of machine learning algorithms for understanding data.\nWhile there are some formulae and computational elements to the course, the emphasis is on applications of acquired concepts to “real life” of research scientists.\nThough the vast majority of what you will learn in this course can be applied in any software package, the seminar will mostly use R for empirical examples and exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\nTentative Schedule\n\nDay\nTime\nActivity\nLocation\n\n\n\n24 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 1 ~ Working with data (in R)\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 1\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n25 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 2 ~ Inference\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 2\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n26 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 3 ~ Modeling correlation and regression\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 3\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n27 July, 2024\n9am - 12am\nLesson 4 ~ Intro to machine learning\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\"\"\n2pm - 5pm\nPractice Session 4\nBuilding ??, Room ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot & cold drinks will be served during the morning breaks.\nPractical information\nPlease, do bring your laptop as no computer will be available.\nAlso, please make sure to have the required software installed ahead of the workshop.
