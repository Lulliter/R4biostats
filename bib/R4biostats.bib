  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients' survival from their data and can individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records.                                         Methods               In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. We apply several machine learning classifiers to both predict the patients survival, and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. We also perform an alternative feature ranking analysis by employing traditional biostatistics tests, and compare these results with those provided by the machine learning algorithms. Since both feature ranking approaches clearly identify serum creatinine and ejection fraction as the two most relevant features, we then build the machine learning survival prediction models on these two factors alone.                                         Results               Our results of these two-feature models show not only that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are sufficient to predict survival of heart failure patients from medical records, but also that using these two features alone can lead to more accurate predictions than using the original dataset features in its entirety. We also carry out an analysis including the follow-up month of each patient: even in this case, serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the most predictive clinical features of the dataset, and are sufficient to predict patients' survival.                                         Conclusions               This discovery has the potential to impact on clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction.},

  abstract = {Background:~Platelets are important mediators of coagulation, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. We conducted a large population study with National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to understand the relationship of total platelet count (TPC) with health and disease in humans. Methods:~NHANES is a cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized United States adults, administered every 2 years by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Participants answer a questionnaire, receive a physical examination, and undergo laboratory tests. TPC values were analyzed for a six-year period of NHANES (2011--2016). Weighted 10th~and 90th~percentiles were calculated, and logistic regression was used to predict likelihood (Odds ratio [OR]) of being in categories with TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile or {$>$} 90th~percentile. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata/SE 15.1, using population weights for complex survey design. Results:~The mean TPC for our sample (N = 17,969) was 236 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L (SD = 59 \texttimes{} 103) with the 10th~percentile 170 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L and the 90th~percentile 311 \texttimes{} 103/\textmu L. Hispanics (other than Mexican Americans) and obese individuals had lower odds of a TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile. Males, Blacks, adults aged {$\geq$} 45 years, and those with a recent (last 12 months) hospital stay were more likely to have a TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile. Obese individuals and Mexican Americans had higher odds of having TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile. Individuals with a congestive heart failure (CHF) or coronary heart disease (CHD) diagnosis had over twice the odds (OR 2.06, 95\% CI: 1.50-2.82, p ={$<$} 0.001, and 2.11, 95\% CI: 1.48-3.01, p ={$<$} 0.001, respectively) of having TPC {$<$}10th~percentile. Individuals with an emphysema or asthma diagnosis were more likely to have TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile (OR 1.84, 95\% CI: 1.08-3.13, p = 0.026, and 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.56, p = 0.046, respectively). A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer did not have significant associations with TPC. Conclusions:~Our study showed that obese individuals are more likely to have higher TPC. Individuals with CHF and CHD had higher odds of having TPC {$<$} 10th~percentile, and those with emphysema and asthma were more likely to have TPC {$>$} 90th~percentile.
