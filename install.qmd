This workshop showcases introductory bio statistics concepts using the open source (and free!) programming language {{< fa brands r-project >}}. Each session of the workshop features exercises that will help you learn by doing. Therefore, it is recommended that you pre-install the following on your machine.


## Installing `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#5F85A7")`

R is available for free for Windows `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-windows", fill = "steelblue")`, GNU/Linux  `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-linux", fill = "steelblue")` and macOS `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-apple", fill = "steelblue")`.  

+ To install it, you can go to this **[link](https://cloud.r-project.org/)**. 
The latest available release is **R 4.3.2 "Eye Holes" released on 2023/10/31**, but any (fairly recent) version will do.  

If you have previously installed R on your machine, you can check which version you are running by executing this command in `R`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# In R console
base::R.version.string
```

...or by executing this command in your `CLI` (Command Line Interface):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# In Terminal/Powershell/bash
R --version
```


## Install RStudio IDE

While this is not required, it is highly recommended that you also install RStudio to facilitate your work. **RStudio Desktop** is an Integrated Development Editor (IDE) wrapping and interfacing R (which needs to be installed first). 

+ To install it you can go to this **[link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**. The free-version contains everything you need.

## Install R packages from the CRAN

Many useful R function come in *packages*, free libraries of code written by R's active user community. **CRAN** - the Comprehensive R Archive Network - is the general package repository for R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).

<!-- The bottom-right panel holds five tabs. -->

<!-- -   Files -->
<!-- -   Plots -->
<!-- -   Packages -->
<!-- -   Help -->
<!-- -   Viewer -->

<!-- Click on the `Packages` tab (1.) and select the select the `Install` button (2.). Type `dplyr` in (3.). You will see the word auto-completion that helps. -->

## R packages that will be required for the workshop 

To install an R package, open an R session execute: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Installing (only the 1st time)
pkg_list <- c("tidyverse", "quarto", "rmarkdown", "palmerpenguins")
install.packages(pkg_list)

# Loading a package (at every session) 
library ("tidyverse")
```

<!-- ## Install [Quarto] -->

<!--  - Install latest version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (v1.0.36 or greater) -->
<!-- - After installing Quarto, open the terminal in RStudio and: -->
<!--   - See [this guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal-in-the-RStudio-IDE) for details on using the terminal -->
<!--   - Install/Update TinyTeX for PDFs with `quarto install tool tinytex` -->
<!--   - Install/Update Chromium with `quarto install tool chromium` -->
