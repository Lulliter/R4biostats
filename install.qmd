This workshop showcases introductory bio statistics concepts using the open source (and free!) programming language {{< fa brands r-project >}}. Each session of the workshop features exercises that will help you learn by doing. Therefore, it is recommended that you pre-install the following on your machine.

Below is quick step by step process that can help you get started.

# Install `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#5F85A7")`

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-windows", fill = "steelblue")` -->

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-linux", fill = "steelblue")` -->

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-apple", fill = "steelblue")` -->

**R** is available for free for Windows [{{< fa brands windows >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}, GNU/Linux [{{< fa brands linux >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}, and macOS [{{< fa brands apple >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}.

-   To install **R**, you can go to this [**link**](https://cloud.r-project.org/). The latest available release is **R 4.3.3 "Angel Food Cake" released on 2024-02/29**, but any (fairly recent) version will do.

If you have previously installed R on your machine, you can check which version you are running by executing this command in `R`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# From the R console
base::R.version.string
    # (This is the version on my own machine)
    # [1] "R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)"
```

...or by executing this command in your `CLI` (Command Line Interface):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# From Terminal/Powershell/bash
R --version
```

# Install RStudio IDE

While not strictly required, it is highly recommended that you also install RStudio to facilitate your work. **RStudio Desktop** is an Integrated Development Editor (IDE), basically a graphical interface wrapping and interfacing R (which needs to be installed first).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
R, which is a command line driven program, can be executed via its native interface (**R GUI**), as well as from many other code editors, like **VS Code**, **Sublime Text**, **Jupyter Notebook**, etc. **RStudio** remains the most widely used by beginners and advanced programmers alike, because of its intuitive and integrated interface.
:::

-   To install **RStudio** you can go to this [**link**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The free-version contains everything you need.

# Install R packages from the CRAN

An **R *package*** is a shareable bundle of functions. Besides the basic built-in functions already contianed in the program (i.e. the `base` package), many useful R functions come in free libraries of code (or *packages*) written by R's user community.

-   **CRAN** - the Comprehensive R Archive Network - is the general package repository for R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>.

-   **Bioconductor** -

-   **Github** -

<!-- Click on the `Packages` tab (1.) and select the select the `Install` button (2.). Type `dplyr` in (3.). You will see the word auto-completion that helps. -->

## Installing and using R packages

Let's take for example the R package `corr`, a package for graphically exploring correlations. To install it for the first time, open an R session and execute:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Installing (ONLY the 1st time)
utils::install.packages('corrplot')
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
Here you are actually using a ***function*** (`install.packages`) of a pre-installed ***package*** (`utils`) using the syntax `packagename::function_name`
:::

Once you have installed a package, at every subsequent R session, you will only need to load it, like so:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Loading a package (at every session) 
base::library (corrplot)

# ... or with ""
base::library ("corrplot")
```

To inquire about a package and/or its functions, you can again write in your console `?package_name` or `?function_name` and RStudio will open up a help page in the dedicated pane of Rstudio:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Opening Help page on package/function
?corrplot
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
You can also install and update packages using the "Packages" tab on the lower righ pane of RStudio

# R packages that will be required for the workshop

To install an R package, open an R session execute:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Installing (only the 1st time)
pkg_list <- c("tidyverse", "quarto", "rmarkdown", "palmerpenguins")
install.packages(pkg_list)

# Loading a package (at every session) 
library ("tidyverse")
```

<!-- ## Install [Quarto] -->

<!--  - Install latest version of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (v1.0.36 or greater) -->

<!-- - After installing Quarto, open the terminal in RStudio and: -->

<!--   - See [this guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal-in-the-RStudio-IDE) for details on using the terminal -->

<!--   - Install/Update TinyTeX for PDFs with `quarto install tool tinytex` -->

<!--   - Install/Update Chromium with `quarto install tool chromium` -->
