R is available for free for Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS. The version required for this course is 4.3.1. As for now, the latest version is 4.3.2 but there is no need to update. Participants using earlier versions (in particular 4.1.2 and before) will not be able to complete all examples presented. Please update.

## Install RStudio IDE

RStudio Desktop is an Integrated Development Editor wrapping and interfacing R that needs to be installed first. The free-version contains everything you need.

As for now, the latest version is 2023.06.2.+561. We recommend updating if you're using older versions.

## Install R packages from the CRAN

Click on the `Packages` tab (1.) and select the select the `Install` button (2.). Type `dplyr` in (3.). You will see the word auto-completion that helps.
