This workshop showcases introductory bio statistics concepts using the open source (and free!) programming language {{< fa brands r-project >}}. Each session of the workshop features exercises that will help you learn by doing. 

We will quickly go over this at our first Practice session, but you are expected to have the required software installed on your machine **before** the workshop.

Below is a step by step process that should guide you through the needed installation steps.

# Install `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#5F85A7")`

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-windows", fill = "steelblue")` -->

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-linux", fill = "steelblue")` -->

<!-- `r fontawesome::fa("fab fa-apple", fill = "steelblue")` -->

**R** is available for free for Windows [{{< fa brands windows >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}, GNU/Linux [{{< fa brands linux >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}, and macOS [{{< fa brands apple >}}]{style="color:#d8717b"}.

-   To install **R**, you can go to this [**link**](https://cloud.r-project.org/). The latest available release is **R 4.4.1 "Race for Your Life" released on 2024/06/14**, but any (fairly recent) version will do.

If you have previously installed R on your machine, you can check which version you are running by executing this command in `R`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# From the R console
base::R.version.string
    # (This is the version on my own machine)
    # [1] "R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)"
```

...or by executing this command in your `CLI` (Command Line Interface):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# From Terminal/Powershell/bash
R --version
```

# Install RStudio IDE

While not strictly required, it is highly recommended that you also install RStudio to facilitate your work. **RStudio Desktop** is an Integrated Development Editor (IDE), basically a graphical interface wrapping and interfacing R (which needs to be installed first).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
R, which is a command line driven program, can be executed via its native interface (**R GUI**), as well as from many other code editors, like **VS Code**, **Sublime Text**, **Jupyter Notebook**, etc. **RStudio** remains the most widely used by beginners and advanced programmers alike, because of its intuitive and integrated interface.
:::

- To install **RStudio** you can go to this [**link**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
- The free **RStudio Desktop** version contains everything you need.
- Again, you don't need to have the latest RStudio version, but I recommend **v2022.07.1** or later (it also includes the installation of Quarto)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit (former RSTUDIO company). While for R users it is not much different form `Rmarkdown` (you can author files with extension .qmd which are very similar), its key feature is that is It is available also for Python, Julia, and Observable languages. 

+ Quarto is not an R package so it has to be downloaded separately. However Rstudio v2022.07.1 or later come with Quarto included

+ The [www.R4biostats.com](www.R4biostats.com) is actually a quarto website ðŸ˜Š

# Install R packages from the CRAN

An **R *package*** is a shareable bundle of functions. Besides the basic built-in functions already contained in the program (i.e. the `base` package), many useful R functions come in free libraries of code (or *packages*) written by R's user community.

-   **CRAN** - the Comprehensive R Archive Network - is the general package repository for R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

(We will only use packages from CRAN for our purposes) 

-   **Bioconductor** - a  package repository geared towards biostatistics: [https://www.bioconductor.org/](https://www.bioconductor.org/)

-   **Github** - a repository where you can find developerâ€™s version of a package: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)


# R packages that will be required for the workshop

Below are the R packages, that we will need for the workshop's practical sessions. Ideally, you can pre-install them (at least the ones needed fo Lab # 1)... it will also serve as a test to check whether the R version you have is compatible. 

A couple of things to be aware of when installing R packages: 

1. By default, the RStudio IDE uses the **RStudio CRAN global mirror** (i.e. a particular instance of the repository with all the packages code), but you can also override such default CRAN mirror and choose another one (perhaps one mirror hosted at an institution near you) -- see below.

### {{< bi terminal-fill color=rgba(155,103,35,1.00) >}} [OPTIONAL] Choose CRAN mirror from RStudio
[You don't have to, but] you can access and chose a CRAN repository of your choice from the RStudio IDE.

1. ![Access CRAN mirror selection](images/CRAN_mirror1.png) 
2. ![Select from menu - close to you](images/CRAN_mirror2.png)  
:::

2. R may ask you to install some related packages (`dependencies`): if so, follow instructions by responding directly in the R console (normally you are asked to type "Yes" or "No")

3. At the end of the installation process you will get a message (bottom of the R Console) indicating were the source code for the package(s) has been stored on your machine. 

## Installing packages (1st time you use an R Package)

You could install one package at a time...
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Installing (**ONLY** the 1st time you use them)
install.packages("name_of_package_here" ) 

```

... or in bulk, like so (it might take a few moments more):
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# ---- Installing R pckgs for 1st LAB (**ONLY** the 1st time you use them)
pkg_list_lab_1 <- c("fs","here", "janitor", "skimr", 
                   "dplyr", "forcats", 
                   "ggplot2",  "ggridges")

install.packages(pkg_list_lab_1)


# ---- Installing (more) R pckgs for 2nd LAB (**ONLY** the 1st time you use them)
pkg_list_lab_2 <- c("tidyr", "patchwork",
                    "ggthemes", "ggstatsplot", "ggpubr",  "viridis",
                    "BSDA", "rstatix", "car", "multcomp") 

install.packages(pkg_list_lab_2)


# ----  Installing (more) R pckgs for 3rd LAB (**ONLY** the 1st time you use them)
pkg_list_lab_3 <- c("openxlsx", 
                    "lmtest" , 
                    "broom", 
                    "performance")

install.packages(pkg_list_lab_3)


# ----  Installing (more) R pckgs for 4th LAB (**ONLY** the 1st time you use them)
# pkg_list_lab_4 <- c("" )
# 
# install.packages(pkg_list_lab_4)
```

## Loading a package (at the beginning of every R session)
With the commands below (that we will be executing at the beginning of our Labs), you load the specific R packages that you are going to need in any given R session. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Loading a package (at the beginning of every R session) 
# --- General 
library(here)       # tools find your project's files, based on working directory
library(fs)         # file/directory interactions
library(janitor)    # tools for examining and cleaning data
library(skimr)      # Compact and Flexible Summaries of Data     
library(openxlsx)   # Read, Write and Edit xlsx Files

# --- Tidyverse

```

## Learning about a package (after installation)

Once an R package is installed, you can check out the documentation about it directly inside the RStudio ID. Try running for example:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# - To ask about a package
?here

# -- To ask about a specific function
?janitor::clean_names

?dplyr::group_by
```


# R coding tips and tricks 

## Useful keyboard shortcuts in RStudio

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true

library(tibble)
library(flextable)

key_short <- tibble::tribble (
  ~Description, 	             ~'Windows & Linux',     ~'Mac', 
  "Insert code section", 	     "Ctrl+Shift+R",       	"Shift+Command+R  or Ctrl+Shift+R",

  "File path completion (console)",    "\"+Tab", "\"+Tab"
)

 	
key_short_ft <- key_short %>% 
  # adorn_percentages(  denominator = 'row', na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  flextable() %>% 
 #   flextable::set_header_labels(key_stakes_types = "Type of agencies most frequently involved", N = "N. of cases") %>% 
  bold( bold = TRUE,   part = "header") %>% 
  color( color = "white",   part = "header") %>% 
  bg( bg = "#d8717b",   part = "header") %>% 
  bg( bg = "#F2F2F2", part = "body", source = j) %>% 
  fontsize( i = NULL, j = NULL, size = 11, part = "body") %>% 
  # bg(bg =bordeaux_light, i = ~  `Type of agencies most frequently involved` %in%  c ( "more than 1 agency involved" ), part = "body") %>% 
  fontsize(size = 14, part = "header") %>% 
  fontsize(size = 12, part = "body") %>% 
  autofit() 


key_short_ft
