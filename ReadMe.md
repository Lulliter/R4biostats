# How this website was built 

This is a static website built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), shared on a Github [repo](https://github.com/Lulliter/R4biostats) and deployed via [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to be rendered at this [link](https://lulliter.github.io/R4biostats/).

The main content of the website pages is contained in *Quarto Markdown* files (`*.qmd`). This is very similar to regular Markdown (`*.md`) and R Markdown (`*.rmd`) files, except they are designed to be language agnostic.

## Things needed 

1. Install **Quarto** (an open source tool that can be used from RStudio, Jupyter, CLI, etc.)... Most R users will use RStudio
2. Install **git** (distributed version control software)... here some [instructions](https://github.com/git-guides)
3. Create a **Github** account 
4. Follow instructions/examples available [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)...
